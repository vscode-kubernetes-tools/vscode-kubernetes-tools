# Visual Studio Code Kubernetes Tools

A Visual Studio Code extension for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.  This extension combines
the `vs-kubernetes` extension by @brendandburns and the `vs-helm` extension by @technosophos.

## Configuring

### Setting up your environment

This extension assumes that you have a `Dockerfile` in the root directory of
your project.

It also assumes that you have the following binaries on your `PATH`:
   * `kubectl`
   * `docker`
   * `git`
   * `helm` (optional)
   * `draft` (optional)

If you don't have those on your PATH then the extension will fail in
unexpected ways.

For setting up `kubectl` you have a couple of additional options:

   * If `kubectl` is not on your PATH then you can tell the extension its location using the `vs-kubernetes.kubectl-path` workspace setting. This should be the full file name and path of the kubectl binary.
   * If you are using the extension to work with Azure Container Services or Azure Kubernetes Services then you can install and configure `kubectl` using the `Kubernetes Configure from Cluster` command.

### Setting up your environment for Helm and Draft

`helm` support requires that you have Helm installed and configured.  From there you should also install `helm-template`:

`$ helm plugin install https://github.com/technosophos/helm-template`

To use the `Helm: DryRun` command, your Kubernetes cluster must be running Tiller.

For setting up `draft` you can provide a path to the binary via configuration (`vs-kubernetes.draft-path`) if it is not on your PATH.

### Setting up the image repository path

If you want to use the `Kubernetes: Run` and `Kubernetes: Debug` features
then you need to have correctly set the user and repository for your
images. You can do this via preferences in VS Code:

File > Preferences

And then add:

```javascript
{
  ...
  "vsdocker.imageUser": "<your-image-prefix-here>",
  ...
}
```

Where `<your-image-prefix-here>` is something like `docker.io/brendanburns`.

## Features

`vs-kubernetes` supports a number of commands for interacting with Kubernetes; these are accessible via the command menu (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and may be bound to keys in the normal way.

### General commands

   * `Kubernetes: Load` - Load a resource from the Kubernetes API and create a new editor window.
   * `Kubernetes: Get` - Get the status for a specific resource.
   * `Kubernetes: Logs` - Get logs for a pod in an output window.

### Commands while viewing a Kubernetes file

   * `Kubernetes: Explain` - Use the `kubectl explain ...` tool to annotate Kubernetes API objects
   * `Kubernetes: Create` - Create an object using the current document
   * `Kubernetes: Delete` - Delete an object contained in the current document.
   * `Kubernetes: Apply` - Apply changes to an object contained in the current document.
   * `Kubernetes: Expose` - Expose the object in the current document as a service.

### Commands for application directories

   * `Kubernetes: Run` - Run the current application as a Kubernetes Deployment
   * `Kubernetes: Terminal` - Open an interactive terminal session in a pod of the Kubernetes Deployment
   * `Kubernetes: Exec` - Run a command in a pod of the Kubernetes Deployment
   * `Kubernetes: Debug` - Run the current application as a Kubernetes Deployment and attach a debugging session to it (currently works only for Node.js deployments)
   * `Kubernetes: Remove Debug` - Remove the deployment and/or service created for a `Kubernetes Debug` session

### Configuration commands

   * `Kubernetes Configure from Cluster` - Install and configure the Kubernetes command line tool (kubectl) from an Azure Container Service (ACS) or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster


### Miscellaneous commands

   * `Kubernetes Open Dashboard` - Opens the Kubernetes Dashboard in your browser.

### Helm support

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is the package manager for Kubernetes and provides a way for you to define, install and upgrade applications using 'charts.'  This extension provides a set of tools for creating and testing Helm charts:


   * Syntax highlighting for YAML + Helm Templates
   * Autocomplete for Helm, Sprig, and Go Tpl functions
   * Help text (on hover) for Helm, Sprig, and Go Tpl functions
   * Snippets for quickly scaffolding new charts and templates
   * Commands for...
     * `Helm: Lint` - Lint your chart
     * `Helm: Preview Template` - Open a preview window and preview how your template will render
     * `Helm: Template` - Run your chart through the template engine
     * `Helm: DryRun` - Run a helm install --dry-run --debug on a remote cluster and get the results
     * `Helm: Version` - Get the Helm version
     * `Helm: Dependency Update` - Update a chart's dependencies.
   * Code lenses for:
     * requirements.yaml (Add and update dependencies)
   * Right-click on a chart .tgz file, and choose inspect chart to preview all configurable chart values.

### Draft support

[Draft](http://blog.kubernetes.io/2017/05/draft-kubernetes-container-development.html) is a tool to simplify the process of developing a new Kubernetes application, by creating the necessary deployment components and by keeping code in the cluster in sync with the code on your computer.

  * `Draft: Create` - Set up Draft in the current folder (prerequisite for syncing using Draft)
  * `Draft: Up` - Runs Draft to watch the current folder and keep the cluster in sync with it

**NOTE:** Draft itself is in 'draft' form and is not yet stable. So the extension support for Draft is strictly experimental - assumptions may break, and commands and behavior may change!

## Extension Settings

   * `vs-kubernetes` - Parent for Kubernetes-related extension settings
       * `vs-kubernetes.namespace` - The namespace to use for all commands
       * `vs-kubernetes.kubectl-path` - File path to the kubectl binary. Note this is the binary file itself, not just the directory containing the file. On Windows, this must contain the `.exe` extension.
       * `vs-kubernetes.draft-path` - File path to the draft binary. Note this is the binary file itself, not just the directory containing the file. On Windows, this must contain the `.exe` extension.
   * `vsdocker.imageUser` - Image prefix for docker images e.g. 'docker.io/brendanburns'

## Known Issues

  * `Kubernetes: Debug` command currently works only with Node.js applications
  * For deeply nested Helm charts, template previews are generated against highest (umbrella) chart values (though for `Helm: Template` calls you can pick your chart)

## Release Notes

See the [change log](CHANGELOG.md).

## Telemetry
This extension collects telemetry data to help us build a better experience for building applications with Kubernetes and VS Code. We only collect data on which commands are executed. We do not collect any information about image names, paths, etc. The extension respects the `telemetry.enableTelemetry` setting which you can learn more about in our [FAQ](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting).
