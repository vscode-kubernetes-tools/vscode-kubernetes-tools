## 0.1.11

* Moved the Clusters tree view to a new activity bar view.

## 0.1.10

* The Load command now defaults to YAML format instead of JSON.  You can override this using the `vs-kubernetes.outputFormat` configuration setting.
* Added support for specifying an alternate kubeconfig file, using the `vs-kubernetes.kubeconfig` configuration setting.  (If you set this, it overrides the KUBECONFIG environment variable or default kubeconfig path.)
* Manage individual entries within a config map or secret resource
* Fixed an issue where you got spurious save prompts when you loaded a resource from the cluster and then closed it without making any changes.
* Fixed an issue where if you loaded a resource, then loaded it again while the window was still open, the JSON/YAML would get appended to the existing JSON/YAML.
* Clarified that the extension works with any Kubernetes cluster, not just Azure!

Thanks to contributors Brendan Burns and Bhargav Nookala.

## 0.1.9

* Added configmaps and secrets to the tree view.
* If you auto-install Draft you now get 0.14.1.
* Added new regions to create AKS cluster wizard.
* Fixed an issue where you could not edit or save resource manifests loaded via command or tree view. (The downside of the fix: we've brought back an issue where you get spurious save prompts if you just want to look at a resource without modifying or saving it. We're trying to work out a better solution!)
* Fixed some commands complaining unnecessarily if there was no editor open.
* Fixed error if you clicked on a service without a selector in the tree view.
* Improved documentation of building and running from source.

Thanks to contributors Brendan Burns and Andy Xu.

## 0.1.8

* Added support for debugging using Draft.

* If the extension detects that a binary (kubectl, Helm, Draft) it needs is missing, it offers to install it for you.

* Added a drill-down in the tree view for pods created by a deployment.
* Fixed reference to Azure Container Service when adding an AKS cluster.
* Fixed Open Dashboard command on AKS.
* Improved error messages when no document open, or open document is not JSON or YAML.
* Removed obsolete reference to helm-template plugin.

Thanks to contributors Brendan Burns, Dong Liu, Evan Louie, Radu Matei, Bhargav Nookala and Andy Xu.

## 0.1.7

* Improvements to Kubernetes YAML intellisense.  These improvements depend on the 'YAML Support by Red Hat' extension; please install version 0.0.10 or above of this extension if you are working with Kubernetes YAML files.
* You can now copy a resource name from the tree view.
* The 'choose resource' prompt now supports ingresses.

* Fixed the error if you tried to run `Helm: Create` with no folder open.
